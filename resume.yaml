name: James Holmes

summary: |
  I am a *full-stack* programmer.

  I craft compelling interactions between people and machines and bring a diverse background of
  technologies, experiences and passions. I want to help create the tools and applications that will
  empower the next generation to work, play, communicate, and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;*build*.

  If you share my love for programming&mdash;whether a fellow developer, a potential
  employer or client, or just someone who wants to learn&mdash;I would love to hear from you!

      Leads To Conversations is a sales acceleration app start-up, founded by a pair previous
      co-workers. I joined the team as the second developer&mdash;third employee&mdash;as a UI
      generalist. My skill-set directly complements the skills of the technical founder; we worked
      closely to define, architect and build the pilot system. Being a small cross-functional team,
      responsibilities ranged from full-stack pair development, to database design,
      to devops, to graphic/web design, to marketing, to motion graphics and more!

    description: |
      As the lead front-end developer, I worked closely with the lead designer to realize and
      iterate on the UI/UX of the application: a UAV flight planning, logging, and compliance SAAS.
      I took a deep-dive into Angular.js and established the initial testing and build pipeline. Helped
      mentor junior developers within the front-end stack, and helped expose and transition
      the team to more functional programming paradigms available in Java 8.

      I really enjoyed working at VersionOne; the team was well established and full of some of the
      smartest and passionate people I've had the opportunity to work with. It is also where I fell
      in love with pair-programming. I was joined as a full-stack developer, with a focus on UI
      and Front-End development.

      My biggest achievement, while at VersionOne, was being the Feature Lead of a team of 4
      developers on a high-profile, well-received [feature](https://www.versionone.com/product/agile-team-software/)
      of the flag-ship application. During the last year at VersionOne, I was tapped to be a Team
      Lead, one of only three on the development team at the time. I helped guide, mentor, and
      support the other devs and designers on my team and coordinate with the other teams and Product
      Owners.

      While initially hired as a technical test developer; I was quickly conscripted on to the
      development team where I helped mentor the team in C#, ASP.NET MVC, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery
      as a Front-End Developer. Over the course of two years, I was helped establish best-design
      practices for the development team. I continued to work closely with both the business
      analysts and development teams to plan, architect, build and maintain the BDD test suite. Finally,
      I served as team ScrumMaster until my departure.

    technologies:
      - *ActionScript
      - { name: AGAL }
      - { name: Flash }
    description: |
      The work done while consulting for BAS was some of the *most interesting* work I've gotten
      to do. They needed a library of reusable custom UI-framework components, the most ambitious of which
      was a custom mobile/desktop ready real-time 3D panoramic viewer in Flash.
      I had to dust off several math textbooks from college and refresh my working memory of
      vector and matrix math, but it was great fun to implement a 3D renderer from almost first
      principals. A lot more work went into optimizing performance and building an API and
      documentation for RAD consumption by graphic designers and other junior developers.

    description: |
      FourSpots was an ambitious self-service advertising platform and market-place start-up, where I helped
      implement and hack together back-end and front-end services. Created API interfaces for custom
      video editing and rendering services on top of FFMPEG and Avisynth, as well as custom
      SWF packing for ad distribution.

teaching:
  - organization: CoderDojo Ponce Springs
    title:        Volunteer Mentor
    from:         '2013-05'
    to:           '2014-08'
    notes: |
      I had a *ton* of fun mentoring at the CoderDojo. The effort was spearheaded by a co-worker and
      we had buy&#x2011;in/support from our employer. With a half-dozen mentors and teachers, we had
      classes and self-directed sessions for dozens of children between the ages of 10 and 17.
      The environment could be chaotic and challenging at times, but the reward was helping expose
      the truly curious to fundamentals of technology and programming.

  - organization: ITT Technical Institute
    title:        Adjunct Instructor
    from:         '2008-02'
    to:           '2011-12'
    notes: |
      Leveraging my professional experience, in both the visual arts and software development, I
      taught a range of classes in the department: from Graphic Design to Web Design to Game
      Development. Teaching mostly after-work night-classes, the schedule was demanding but
      rewarding. The experience was formative in my respect for the power of education and its value
      in both academic and professional environments.

education:
  - school:   Art Institute of Atlanta
    location: Atlanta, GA
    program:  BFA Media Arts and Animation
    from:     '2000-07'
    to:       '2004-04'
    notes: |
      My college experience helped solidify my interest in the intersection between visual arts and
      code. Classes like Color Theory, Typography and Life Drawing have made an unexpected impact
      during my professional career. And the 3D Modeling and Animation classes were my first exposure
      to the confluence art and mathematics. During my senior year, I was the teaching assistant for
      most of the 3D Modeling and Animation classes; my first foray into teaching and education.
